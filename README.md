### 🚀 About Me

I'm an Embedded Systems Engineer passionate about **low-level development**, real-time applications, and **Embedded Linux**. I specialize in creating robust, scalable firmware for a wide variety of **8, 16, and 32-bit microcontrollers**, with deep experience on **ARM Cortex-M** platforms.

I thrive working close to the hardware—whether it's **bare-metal firmware**, **RTOS-based designs (Zephyr, FreeRTOS)**, or **Yocto-based embedded Linux**. From drivers and protocol stacks to board bring-up and system optimization, I enjoy solving real-world problems at the firmware level.

### 🧠 Areas of Expertise

- **Low-Level Firmware**: Peripheral drivers, memory-mapped I/O, power management, bootloaders  
- **Zephyr RTOS**: Device Tree, custom drivers, multithreading, IPC, networking  
- **Embedded Linux (Yocto Project):** Kernel customization, development and integration of device drivers, as well as the implementation of daemons for managing services in the system.
